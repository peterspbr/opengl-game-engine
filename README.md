# opengl-game-engine
Minecraft like voxel game engine written in C++ and OpenGL.

**This is a personal project for learning purposes only**
I let it public for people who wants to learn about voxel worlds generation algorithms.
If you want to fork this repository and make your own modifications, feel free to it, but i will **not** merge any pull request.

## Building
### Libraries
In order to build this project you will need some opengl libraries installed, so make sure you have `glfw3`, `glew` and your graphics card supports OpenGL core.
### Build command
To build this project just open up a terminal and input the following command `g++ -o somename src/main.cpp -lGL -lGLEW -lglfw`.
### To do list
This project will be updated according to my learning progress, so it need a lot of content implementation, such as
* Face culling
* Chunk generation
* Oclussion culling
* Physics
* Perlin noise generation
* Multiple blocks generation
* More shaders
* Trees
* Water
* Fog
* Sounds

I really recommend accessing the [Learn openGL](https://learnopengl.com/) website to learning about opengl.

Enjoy.
